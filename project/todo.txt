batch job: remove old bookings, check bookedTimes every 24 hours
display user's current bookings and give them the option to delete them from the UI
think about how to handle names (ie event names / separate user names vs Google Signin names, flexibility etc - probably put names back into booking class)
implement better date pickers
ensure non-hour dates are dealt with
check bookings in future weeks
make page mobile-responsive
